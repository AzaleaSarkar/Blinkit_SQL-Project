# Blinkit SQL Data Analysis Project
# Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis of a Blinkit-style quick-commerce platform.
The objective is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and order trends using a normalized relational database and business-focused SQL queries.
The project demonstrates real-world SQL skills, including schema design, joins, aggregations, conditional logic, and CTEs.

# Database Schema

The database is designed using relational modeling principles with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

# Tables Used
blinkit_customers – customer demographics and segmentation
blinkit_products – product catalog and pricing details
blinkit_orders – order-level transactional data
blinkit_order_items – item-level order details
blinkit_delivery_performance – delivery metrics and delays
blinkit_inventory – daily inventory movement
blinkit_marketing_performance – campaign-level marketing data

NOTE: Derived metrics such as revenue and AOV are calculated using SQL queries, not stored in tables.

# Business Questions Answered

# Sales & Revenue Analysis
1.What is the total revenue generated by Blinkit?
2.What is the monthly revenue trend?
3.What is the average order value (AOV)?
4.Which day of the week generates the highest revenue?

# Order Analysis
5.How many orders are On Time vs Slightly Delayed?
6.What is the average number of items per order?
7.Which orders have order value above average?
8.What is the distribution of order sizes (Small / Medium / Large)?
9.Which stores handle the highest number of orders?

# Customer Analysis
10.Who are the top 10 customers by total spending?
11.How many repeat customers are there?
12.What is the average number of orders per customer?
13.What is the customer-wise revenue contribution?
14.Which areas have the highest customer concentration?
15.Who are the high-value customers (above average spend)?

# Key SQL Concepts Used
INNER JOIN across multiple tables
Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT
Conditional logic using CASE WHEN
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Subqueries for order-level aggregation
Composite Primary Keys
Business-rule filtering (e.g., Delivered / On Time orders)

# Revenue Calculation Approach
Revenue is calculated using price × quantity at item level, ensuring granular and accurate analysis:

SUM(order_items.quantity * order_items.unit_price)

This approach is preferred for:
1.Product-level revenue analysis
2.Customer spending analysis
3.Avoiding reliance on pre-aggregated fields

# Tools & Technologies
MySQL
MySQL Workbench
Kaggle Dataset
GitHub

# Insights Generated
1.Revenue is concentrated among high-value repeat customers
2.A small percentage of customers contribute a disproportionate share of revenue
3.Certain stores consistently handle higher order volumes
4.Delivery performance has a measurable impact on order completion

# Why This Project?
This project showcases:
1.Practical SQL for analytics
2.Real-world data modeling
3.Business-oriented thinking
